# Ovarian Cyst Detection using MobileNet V2

## Description
This project focuses on developing a deep learning model using the MobileNet V2 architecture to accurately detect ovarian cysts from ultrasound images. The aim is to leverage the efficiency and accuracy of MobileNet V2 to assist medical professionals in the early diagnosis and treatment of ovarian cysts.

## Objectives
- Develop a deep learning model using MobileNet V2 to detect ovarian cysts.
- Achieve high accuracy and efficiency in detecting ovarian cysts from ultrasound images.
- Provide an accessible tool for medical professionals to assist in the diagnosis of ovarian cysts.

## Problem Statements
- Ovarian cysts are a common gynecological problem that can lead to severe health issues if not detected early.
- Traditional methods of ovarian cyst detection rely heavily on the expertise of medical professionals and can be time-consuming.
- There is a need for an automated, efficient, and accurate method to detect ovarian cysts from ultrasound images.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- TensorFlow
- Keras
- OpenCV
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib

## Methodology
1. **Data Collection**: Gather a dataset of ultrasound images labeled for the presence or absence of ovarian cysts.

2. **Data Preprocessing**: Preprocess the images to ensure they are suitable for training the model, including resizing, normalization, and augmentation.
3. **Model Development**: Develop the MobileNet V2 model using TensorFlow and Keras.
4. **Training**: Train the model on the preprocessed dataset and fine-tune the hyperparameters to achieve optimal performance.
5. **Evaluation**: Evaluate the model's performance on a separate validation set to ensure accuracy and generalizability.

## Installation
1. **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/swaps361/ovarian-cyst-detection.git
    cd ovarian-cyst-detection
    ```

2. **Install the required dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. **Run each cell to perform the workflow:**
    run each cell one by one to generate the outputs


## Model Performance
The MobileNet V2 model was trained on the dataset and evaluated for its performance. Below are the key results:

- **Training Accuracy**: 93.16%
- **Validation Accuracy**: 97.01%
